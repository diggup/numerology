ONE(1): Unity, or the Monad, expressed by the figure 1, symbolizes the Omnipotent Deity, the "oneness" of Divine Purpose, the beginning of all things, the singleness yet boundlessness of the Godhead. It represents the pinnacle or highest point, the focus of the circumference, the hub of the universe, and the single Parent of the whole world. The universal symbol which conveys this idea is a point enclosed by a circle. Because the Deity is generally conceived of as being masculine and the male species is believed to have been created first, the Monad is generally associated with the male rather than the female sex.

Character Influences: Those who come under the influence of the Monad will show great tenacity and a singleness of purpose. It indicates self-reliance, an unswerving desire for action, resolve, ingenuity, concentration, great achievement and possibly genius. Persons controlled by the number 1 can be implicitly relied upon; they seem to take pleasure in the assumption of great responsibilities. They will not be content to lead aimless, subordinate lives, but will seek new and perhaps hazardous paths which will lead them onward to their goal. Usually they will be friendly and considerate towards others and will do all they can to assist those in distress.

The less admirable influences which may be exerted by the number 1 are intolerance, narrow-mindedness, conceit, obstinacy. Those who are highly ambitious and resolute may be inclined to depreciate the value of the work or actions of others. They may consider themselves above receiving advice from their friends and stubbornly persist in an enterprise which is obviously doomed to failure. Thus they may sometimes be disliked by reason of their haughty independence. If you are influenced by the Monad you should attempt to control your self-confidence and be ready to accept the opinions of older and more experienced people.
